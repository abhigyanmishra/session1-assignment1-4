1) Scale up: where this is not a recommended one which the data storage exceeds the limit the storage device capacity can be added up.
as well it a costly,time consuming and a complex process
 	  > Increase the configuration of a single system, like disk capacity, RAM, data transfer
 	  speed, etc.
 	  > Complex, costly, and a time consuming process
 	  
2).Scale out: where here economical machines can be added up instead of adding the data storage through devices.Many number of computers can be added together to share the data's.and this is the better method than scale up.which is economical as well work is distributed among different machines.
 	  > Use multiple commodity (economical) machines and distribute the load of
 	  storage/processing among them
 	  > Economical and quick to implement as it focuses on distribution of load
 	  > Instead of having a single system with 10 TB of storage and 80 GB of RAM, use 40
 	  machines with 256 GB of storage and 2 GB of RAM
