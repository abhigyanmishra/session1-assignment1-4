Scale-up can solve a capacity problem without adding infrastructure elements such as network connectivity. However, it does require 
additional space, power, and cooling. Scaling up does not add controller capabilities to handle additional host activities. That means
it doesn’t add costs for extra control functions either.
So the costs have not scaled at the same rate for the initial storage system plus storage devices – only additional devices have been
added.
Scaling up is a viable scaling solution until it is impossible to scale up individual components any larger. For example,
10GbE is a practical limit for uplinking hosts to the network until such time as 25GbE and higher ports are readily available on hosts.
In that context, what happens when 10GbE is no longer enough bandwidth for the uplinked host? Rather than scaling up, you scale out.
 

Scale-out storage usually requires additional storage (called nodes) to add capacity and performance. Or in the case of monolithic
storage systems, it scales by adding more functional elements (usually controller cards).One difference between scaling out and just
putting more storage systems on the floor is that scale-out storage continues to be represented as a single system.
There are several methods for accomplishing scale out, including clustered storage systems and grid storage. The definitions of these
two types can also be confusing, and other factors add to the complexity (that’s a subject for another article), but the fundamental
premise is that a scale-out solution is accessed as a single system.
